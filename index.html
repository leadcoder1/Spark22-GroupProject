									<p>Our team composition works well together as Jack is a comfortable and confident leader with the others preferring to listen, follow, and handle the tasks given to them, gladly following someone they have trust and confidence in. Lachlan is good at keeping us on track and ensuring we complete our work in the required time frames we have set and has undertaken this role with usual communications between all members. Kevin is the father figure and overall juror, making sure we do not argue or get distracted in the meetings and always pulls us back in line when required. And finally, we have Zach, the creative designer behind the ideas and presentation of our work and the motivator behind us when we are feeling a little lack luster.</p>

The research and analysis on customers and trends can lead to somewhere with more focus on data collection and formatting to progress or assist in business. The experience that will be gained from the development aspects could lead to development in most IT (Information Technology) industries, including web design and video games, and the testing and debugging go hand in hand with helping me along that path too. And the documentation is required in any field where you are trying to convey your thoughts, work, and data. The experience gained from this position can lead Jack to branch into almost any path and industry he could want to extend himself into.</td>

										<h2>Project Idea</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Our project idea is a long distance, self-training, automated ball thrower for dogs. An automated device in which a dog, or person, puts a rubber ball into a feeder. The system would then output a biscuit, or some other form of treat, so the dog is rewarded for returning the ball and is trained to do so. It would then feed the ball into a chamber that would launch the ball with changeable speed and trajectory for different environments.</p>
